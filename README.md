Role Listings
======================

This module adds listings for individual roles to the administration pages, specifically:

* Individual role permission pages as tabs of /admin/config/people/permissions

Lists of users who have particular roles:

* Individual pages listing all users for selecte roles
* A page listing users with any of a specified set of roles.

On Backdrop, the User accounts listing at admin/people allows you to filter by role, so the individual role lists aren't strictly necessary, but it can be useful to have them directly accessible as tabs.

All of the pages above can be turned on or off on the configuration page for this module.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using [the official Backdrop CMS instructions](  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).

- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration > User accounts >
  Role Listings (admin/config/people/role-listings) to specify the roles in the "Special roles" list and/or to turn on or off the display of individual pages.

Usage
------------

- This module does not work well with the [Filter Permissions](https://backdropcms.org/project/filter_perms) module, but they are somewhat complementary and serve similar functions. You should only have one or the other installed.
